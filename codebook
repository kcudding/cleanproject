As indicated in the text file "features_info.txt" from the raw data archive: the measurements selected 
for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals 
tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant 
rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth 
filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was 
then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using 
another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk 
signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals 
were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, 
tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to 
indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in the raw data as 'features.txt'

The summary dataset included only a subset of these measures, using only the "mean()" and "std()" variables, 
and taking the average of these values. The final subset of data is then:

where, in each case the summary data is the average of the indicated 
measure, with the exception of the "activity" column which indicates 
what type of activity was measured for a given average. Note that the column 
names have been tidied up from the raw data so that they do not cause 
programming issues and are easier to understand (e.g., parentheses and dashes
removed)
